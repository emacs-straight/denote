;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file provides specialized extensions to Denote that are
;; specific to Org-mode.  By "specialized", we refer to features that
;; are likely not to be used in casual workflows.

;;; Code:

(require 'denote)
(require 'org)

;;; Org-mode Subtree to new note

;;;###autoload
(defun denote-org-extract-subtree ()
  "Create new Denote note as an Org file using current Org subtree.

The Org-tags are used as note keywords, and the subtree title as note title.
This command deletes the original subtree."
  (interactive)
  (if-let ((text (org-get-entry))
           (heading (org-get-heading :no-tags :no-todo :no-priority :no-comment)))
      (progn
        (delete-region (org-entry-beginning-position) (org-entry-end-position))
        (denote heading (org-get-tags) 'org)
        (insert text))
    (user-error "No subtree to extract; aborting")))

;;; Org-mode Dynamic blocks

;;;; Dynamic block to search links

;; Org-mode has Dynamic blocks the content of which can be computed
;; dynamically based on their header. This functionality can be
;; leveraged to create automated lists of links to specific notes
;; (similar to 'denote-link-add-links', but with the added benefit
;; that the list can be updated easily).
;;
;; A dynamic block of the 'denote-links' type looks like this:
;;
;;     #+BEGIN: denote-links :regexp "denote"
;;
;;     #+END:
;;
;; With point at the #+BEGIN: line, pressing 'C-c C-c' will replace the
;; contents of the block with links to notes matching the search
;; ':regexp'. See also the denote manual on 'denote-link-add-links'.
;;
;; To only include "missing links" (i.e., links to notes that the
;; current buffer doesn't already link to), add ':missing-only t' to
;; the block's header.
;;
;; With ':block-name "string"', include a name in the Dynamic block,
;; formated as '#+NAME: string'. This enables users to use the Dynamic
;; block as inputs for further computation, e.g. in Org source blocks.
;;
;; In summary, Org Dynamic blocks of the denote-links type can have
;; three arguments:
;;  1. :regexp "string" -- the search input (required)
;;  2. :missing-only t  -- to only include missing links
;;  3. :block-name "n"  -- to include a name for later processing
;;
;; Inserting a block can be done via the Org-mode entry point
;; 'org-dynamic-block-insert-dblock' and selecting 'denote-links' from
;; the list, or directly by calling 'denote-org-dblock-insert-links'.
