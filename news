1 Version 4.1.0 on 2025-10-17
═════════════════════════════

  The overarching theme of version `4.1.0' is that of continuing to
  deliver on the highly hackable/flexible/powerful potential of Denote.
  All the core functionality is the same as before and you still only
  need a tiny configuration to use Denote productively. We are adding
  more refinements and subtle improvements under the hood, while making
  it even easier for advanced users/developers to piece together a
  workflow that matches their particular needs.

  Since version `4.0.0', we have moved the “Denote extras” files into
  their own packages. I cover their changes further down after I
  elaborate on all the changes to the core Denote package:

  • 
  • 
  • 

  Note that I write all the release notes by hand. The reason is that I
  consider this process an essential part of my role as a maintainer.
  Taking the time to review and document everything ensures that (i) I
  am well informed about the state of the package, (ii) I did not forget
  anything about this development cycle, and (iii) I take another look
  at the changes we made to ensure everything is in order.


1.1 Overview of the new features for core Denote
────────────────────────────────────────────────

  • The user option `denote-directory' can be assigned to a list of
    directories. The original string value is also acceptable and
    remains the default.

  • Advanced users can define a completely custom scheme for
    identifiers. This can be as simple as automatically assigned ordinal
    numbers to increasingly complex patterns that may also involve user
    input.

  • The command `denote-find-backlink-with-location' is like
    `denote-find-backlink' except it also moves to the exact location of
    the link in the corresponding file.

  • All Denote buffer names share a common prefix, which is subject to
    the user option `denote-buffer-name-prefix'. This makes it easier to
    spot them in the buffer list.

  • The command `denote-dired' (alias `denote-sort-dired') can sort
    files by `random' and `last-modified' in addition to the methods
    that involve Denote file name components.

  • The user option `denote-query-sorting' controls how files in all
    query buffers are sorted by default. This covers backlinks, query
    links for file contents, and any buffer produced by the
    `denote-grep' command. It benefits from the internal “Denote sort”
    mechanism, which is also used by `denote-dired' and the Org dynamic
    blocks of the `denote-org' package.

  Remember that the release notes are true only at the time of
  publication. The single source of truth always is the official manual.


1.2 Set `denote-directory' to a list of directories
───────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The user option `denote-directory' can optionally be bound to a list
  of file system paths, each of which represents a directory root, such
  as `'("/home/prot/Documents/work/" "=/home/prot/Git/hut/")' (Denote
  has always supported subdirectories, even for a singular
  `denote-directory').

  When creating new files, such as with the `denote' command, the first
  directory on the list will be selected. This can be changed by
  modifying the `denote-prompts' user option so that it asks for a
  directory or subdirectory thereof. Or by writing small wrapper …  …
